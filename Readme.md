# ofxPlaylist

A playlist-based animation library. Developed over a couple of years and used in a growing number of permanent installations. 

Playlists hold a sequence of Keyframes, which either:

+ point to values to be tweened over time.
+ pause for a given duration
+ trigger an Event
 
Keyframes are cleared from their Playlist upon completion. Additional Keyframes can be pushed onto the end of any Playlist at any time. Playlists can also be cleared at any time.

## Key Features:

* Tweens using any of Robert Penner' functions via ofxTween
* Pause
* Event Keyframes (special thanks to James George for suggesting these!)
* Internal memory management using ofPtr()
* Keyframes can be set to execute in sequence or in parallel
* Calculate total remaining duration of Playlist
* NEW: Tweens follwing BÃ©zier curves, mirroring the functionality of Adobe After Effects temporal timeline curves.

## Use:

Assuming you'd want to tween pos.x from it's current position when the Playlist starts executing to 0.f:

<pre>

// .h
ofxPlaylist playlist1;

// .cpp

using namespace Playlist;

// call factory function to insert a new keyframe to playlist
// the tween shall last 1000ms (a float value indicates absolute time, an integer time value says you want to use frames as your time base)

playlist1.addKeyFrame(Action::tween(1000.f, &pos.x, 0., TWEEN_SIN, TWEEN_EASE_OUT, &pos.x));

// add a 500ms pause after the tweening ends.
playlist1.addKeyFrame(Action::pause(500.f));

// trigger an event after the 500ms pause ends.
playlist1.addKeyFrame(Action::event(this, "EVENT MESSAGE"));
</pre>
