# ofxPlaylist

A playlist-based animation library. 

A playlist holds a sequence of Keyframes which point to values to be tweened over time.

Keyframes are cleared from their playlist upon completion. 

## Features:

* Any of Robert Penner' tweening functions via ofxTween
* Calculate total remaining duration of Playlist
* Pause Tween
* Event Keyframes
* Combined Keyframes which execute in parallel
* NEW: BÃ©zier curve tweens

## Usage

Assuming you'd want to tween pos.x from it's current position when the Playlist starts executing to 0.f:

<pre>
using namespace Playlist;
playlist.addKeyFrame(Action::tween(1000.f, &pos.x, 0., TWEEN_SIN, TWEEN_EASE_OUT, &pos.x));
playlist.addKeyFrame(Action::pause(500.f));
playlist.addKeyFrame(Action::event(this, "EVENT MESSAGE"));
</pre>
